sum [1,2,3,4]
map (\x -> x^2) [1,2,3,4]  -- Lambda (letter looks like \)
map (^2) [1,2,3,4]         -- Partially applied operator
map (*10) [1,2,3,4]        -- Similar
map (10*) [1,2,3,4]        -- From other side
map (10-) [1,2,3,4]        -- Subtraction
map (-10) [1,2,3,4]        -- Damn you, unary minus!
map ((-)10) [1,2,3,4]      -- Still does not work, because reasons
